  //! A class for interfacing to the microstrain 3dmgx3 and inertialink IMUs
  /*!
   * Note: This class is unreviewed and unsupported. It may change at any
   * time without notice.
   *
   * Many of the methods within this class may throw an
   * microstrain_3dm_gx3::exception, timeout_exception, or
   * corrupted_data_exception.
   *
   * Before using the IMU, it must be opened via the open_port method.
   * When finished using, it should be closed via the close_port
   * method.  Alternatively, close port will get called at
   * destruction.
   *
   * The library is primarily designed to be used in continuous mode,
   * which is enabled with the set_continuous method, and then serviced
   * with one of the receive methods.
   *
   * Implementation of specific polled message transactions can be
   * done with the transact method.
   *
   * Because the timing related to the USB stack is fairly
   * non-deterministic, but the IMU is internally known to be clocked
   * to a 100hz clock, we have wrapped a Kalman filter around calls to
   * get system time, and the internal imu time.  This is only known
   * to be reliable when operating in continuous mode, and if init_time
   * is called shortly prior to beginning to get readings.
   * 
   *
   * Example code:
   * \code
   *   microstrain_3dm_gx3::IMU imu;
   *   imu.open_port("/dev/ttyUSB0");
   *   imu.init_time();
   *   imu.init_gyros();
   *   imu.set_continuous(microstrain_3dm_gx3::IMU::CMD_ACCEL_ANGRATE_ORIENT);
   *   while (int i = 0 ; i < 100; i++)
   *   {
   *     double accel[3];
   *     double angrate[3];
   *     double orientation[9];
   *     imu.receive_accel_angrate_orientation(&time, accel, angrate, orientation);
   *   }
   *   imu.close_port();
   * \endcode
